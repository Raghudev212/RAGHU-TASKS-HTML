<p>This keema curry is made using chopped onions and chopped tomatoes and also added into them are few spices which are available handy at home. The keema curry is pressure cooked which could make our work easy.

The minced meat or keema chosen from fresh red meat tastes good and therefore, chosing a good quality keema is very necessary.
