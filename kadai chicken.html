<p>Kadai Chicken (Chicken Karahi Curry, Karahi Murgh) is a North Indian and Pakistani style chicken curry where chicken is cooked in a spicy freshly ground spice mix.

This dish is traditionally made in an Indian vessel called kadai, a heavy-bottomed pot or a wok, hence the name.

You can replace chicken with other ingredients and make different versions of this kadai curry. Some of my other favorites are Kadai Mushrooms, Kadai Paneer, Kadai Mutton, etc.

Karahi Chicken is also a popular recipe on the menu of most Indian restaurants. It is a great curry for special occasions, festivals, or get-togethers.

The key to making a delicious Kadhai Chicken is its masala powder (spice mix), made fresh by roasting and grinding a few Indian spices.

You get readymade kadai masala powder in the market these days, but I always prefer to make my own at home. Firstly, homemade is made using high-quality ingredients. It tastes much better than the store-bought masala. The homemade spice mix is free of added chemicals, colors, or flavors. It is much more economical to make it at home too.
